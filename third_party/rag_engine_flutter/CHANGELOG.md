# Changelog

## 0.17.0
* **Low-level lane**:
  - Added a generation-pinned `SearchHandle` with metadata-first hybrid search, batch hydration, excerpt fetch, and Rust-side context assembly.
  - Added bounded `SearchHitMeta` plus `StaleSearchHandle` / `ConcurrentMutation` error paths for low-level handle operations.
* **Search / Context**:
  - Added Rust-side context assembly primitives that preserve the current header-path contextual injection and exact engine-tokenizer budgeting contract.
  - Tightened `SearchHandle` hydration/excerpt/assembly generation checks to reject stale handles and mid-operation mutations deterministically.
* **Ingest**:
  - Added UTF-8 bytes and file-based extraction fast paths for additive low-level ingest APIs.
* **Test**:
  - Added regression coverage for generation bumps, stale-handle rejection, concurrent mutations during hydration/assembly, duplicate hydration requests, and low-level lane parity.

## 0.16.0
* **Chunking**:
  - Hardened plain-text heading detection against short imperative, UI-label, and command-style false positives.
  - Clarified the markdown table split contract around raw source-backed slices and non-repeated later headers.
* **Parser / Quality**:
  - Added parser regression coverage for mixed Unicode/PDF-like artifacts.
  - Added an ignored `join_pages()` stress benchmark for release-time performance checks.

## 0.15.0
* **Feat**:
  - Added non-truncating `count_tokens` support for exact engine-tokenizer budgeting paths.
* **Chunking**:
  - Tightened plain-text chunk planning with heading-aware boundaries and boundary-snapped overlap.
  - Standardized chunk offsets around raw source byte ranges for both plain-text and markdown paths.
* **Parser / Runtime**:
  - Promoted CJK newline restoration into the production page-join path.
  - Removed experimental CJK helper leftovers and reduced avoidable clone-heavy paths.

## 0.14.2
* **Fix**:
  - Normalized PDF extraction artifacts (private-use, noncharacter, and control code points) into safe separators to prevent broken box characters in extracted text.
  - Applied normalization before page-number trimming and dehyphenation to improve downstream chunking and embedding stability.
* **Test**:
  - Added regression coverage for malformed PDF spacing artifacts.

## 0.14.1
* **Feat**:
  - Added ingestion safety with claim/status/clear APIs and status-aware indexing in vectors.
* **Refactor**:
  - Refactored `vector_math` module to tighten internal function visibility.

## 0.14.0
* **Vector Math Refactor**:
  - Removed `ndarray` dependency; introduced `vector_math` module with allocation-free dot product, L2 norm, and cosine kernels.
  - Added optional `vector_faer` feature using `faer` crate for SIMD-accelerated vector operations.
* **i8 Scalar Quantization (`vector_quant_i8` feature)**:
  - Added `vector_quant` module with `quantize_f32_to_i8`, `dequantize_i8_to_f32`, and i8 cosine similarity kernels.
  - Updated `init_db` / `init_source_db` schema migration to add `embedding_i8` and `embedding_scale` columns.
  - Linear scan search paths (`search_similar`, `search_chunks_linear_in_collection`) use quantized cosine when available, with f32 fallback.
* **Benchmark API**:
  - Added `benchmark_search_linear_scan()` and `benchmark_search_chunks_linear_in_collection()` FFI entrypoints for deterministic linear scan measurement.
* **Code Quality**:
  - Applied `rustfmt` formatting across all source files.
  - Sorted module declarations alphabetically in `mod.rs`.
  - Removed unused `ndarray` crate dependency from `Cargo.toml`.

## 0.13.0
* **Multi-Collection Core**:
  - Added collection-scoped schema and lifecycle support (`collection_id` on sources/chunks, collection index state).
  - Added collection-aware source/chunk APIs for list/add/delete/stats/rebuild/search paths.
  - Preserved legacy compatibility through default collection mapping.
* **Hybrid Search Isolation**:
  - Extended `SearchFilter` with `collection_id`.
  - Updated exact-scan switching rules to trigger on source/metadata filters while preserving collection post-filter behavior.
  - Added collection-scoped activation hook to align BM25/HNSW in-memory indexes before hybrid search.
* **Reliability & Recovery**:
  - Improved collection activation and index-state transitions for load/rebuild flows.
  - Added/expanded tests for collection isolation, scoped dedupe, and filter semantics.

## 0.12.0
* **Logger Stability (Hot Restart)**:
  - Reworked Dart log sink ownership to `Arc<StreamSink<_>>` for safer cross-thread access.
  - Avoided holding logger locks while sending logs to Dart stream.
  - Switched log stream teardown to non-blocking cleanup to prevent restart deadlocks.
  - Added stale sink recovery on stream send failures.

## 0.11.0
* **Hybrid Search**:
  - Improved source-filter exact-scan path to keep scoped BM25 ranking.
  - Added regression test for source-filter + exact-keyword behavior.
* **Tokenizer**:
  - Added dynamic truncation policy by input length (256/384/512).
* **Chunking**:
  - Applied overlap prefix logic in `semantic_chunk_with_overlap`.
* **BM25**:
  - Improved tokenization to retain meaningful single-char CJK/code tokens.

## 0.10.2
* **Fix**: Corrected HNSW index loading path resolution in `load_hnsw_index`.
* **Fix**: Filtered out verbose debug logs from `hnsw_rs` crate.
* **Stabiity**: Handled uninitialized/empty index cases in `save_hnsw_index` to prevent crashes.

## 0.10.1

  * Fix hnsw uninitialized error.(caused by updating hnsw cargo version)

## 0.10.0
* Maintenance release:
  * Updated dependencies.
  * Internal improvements for `mobile_rag_engine` compatibility.

## 0.9.1
* Improved markdown chunking logic:

  * **Code Block Linking**: Large code blocks split into multiple chunks now carry metadata (`batch_id`, `batch_index`, `batch_total`) to allow reconstructing the original block.
  * **Table Header Repetition**: Large tables split across chunks now automatically repeat the header row in every chunk to maintain column context.
